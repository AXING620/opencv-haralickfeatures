Implementation of GLCM Haralick Features using openCV, based in Haralick et. al (1979)

Calculates the Co-ocurrence matrix from an openCV \<uchar\> Mat object and process it to extract relevant texture information according to the paper

12 from 14 features of the paper are implemented. "Maximal Correlation Coefficient" was ignored for being notoriously unstable in the literature and "Sum of Squares: Variance" was avoided for ambiguity of the meaning of Î¼ in the formulae
